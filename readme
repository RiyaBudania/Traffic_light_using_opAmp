# üö¶ Traffic Light using Op-Amp IC 741

A simple **automatic traffic light simulation** using analog electronics principles. This project demonstrates how an **Op-Amp (IC 741)** can be used in conjunction with RC timing circuits to automate the switching between **RED**, **YELLOW**, and **GREEN** lights.

## üìå Project Overview

This project simulates a basic traffic signal system using **comparators** built with **IC 741 Op-Amps**. The RC circuits are designed to create **time delays** that control the LED phases.

---

## üß∞ Components Used

- IC 741 Operational Amplifiers (3x)
- Resistors (fixed and variable)
- Capacitors (for timing circuits)
- LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Power Supply (¬±12V or 9V dual)
- Breadboard & jumper wires

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

- Each **IC 741** is configured as a **comparator**.
- **RC timing circuits** are used to create **delays** in voltage levels.
- These delays trigger the Op-Amps to switch states.
- As voltage levels rise or fall, corresponding **LEDs light up in sequence** (Red ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Green).
- The result is a **continuous cycle** mimicking real-world traffic signals.

## üîÑ Sequence Logic

1. **RED** LED turns ON for a few seconds.
2. **YELLOW** LED blinks or stays ON for a short delay.
3. **GREEN** LED turns ON to allow traffic flow.
4. Cycle repeats.
